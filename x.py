Ahhh yes! Now I see exactly üòÑ

Rule:

* Swap **each `l`** with the vowel **immediately before it**, if there is one.
* If there‚Äôs **no vowel before the `l`**, do nothing.

Apply to your examples:

* `label` ‚Üí `lable` ‚úÖ (`e` before `l`)
* `default` ‚Üí `defalut` ‚úÖ (`a` before `l`)
* `table` ‚Üí stays `table` ‚ùå (no vowel immediately before `l`)

---

Applying to your full sentence:

Original:

> out of range? jump to the default label! otherwise, you can go to the jump table. In the end, jump to the return label.

Step by step:

* `default` ‚Üí `defalut`
* `label` ‚Üí `lable`
* `table` ‚Üí `table` (unchanged)
* `label` ‚Üí `lable`

‚úÖ Final:

> out of range? jump to the defalut lable! otherwise, you can go to the jump table. In the end, jump to the return lable.

---

This fully respects the ‚Äúswap with previous vowel only‚Äù rule.

If you want, I can **apply this to your whole assembly/jump table explanation** for a fun Klym-flavored version. Do you want me to do that?
